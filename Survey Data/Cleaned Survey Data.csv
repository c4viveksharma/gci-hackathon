Especially in rural areas, people have limited access to the clubfoot treatment facilities due to geographical barriers.
2. Poverty: Many people have to spend money for repeated visits to complete the treatment and they have to sacrifice a daily wage for that day. This also impacts their decision to continue the treatment after few days.
3. Unavailability of trained doctors: Many hospitals do not have trained doctors to treat clubfoot effectively.

Currently, 90.3% of the population is covered by insurance, meaning they can access health services for free, including treatment for clubfoot. However, this insurance only covers casting, tenotomy/surgery, and brace follow-up, excluding assistive technologies/FABs. The national health insurance covers only 7 types of ATs, excluding FABs.
- Locally made FABs lack standardization, resulting in varying quality. Many are of low quality and incorrect models but are sold at high prices.
- There are still no official guidelines from the Ministry of Health or orthopedic/pediatric orthopedic associations clearly stating that the Ponseti method is the preferred treatment for clubfoot, leading to variations in treatment approaches among doctors.
- Due to the absence of official guidelines on the Ponseti method, there is no centralized mechanism for standardized treatment, monitoring, and evaluation of quality.
- For context, clubfoot management in Indonesia falls solely under the management and scope of orthopedic units, meaning other professions (e.g., medical rehabilitation practitioners) do not have the authority to treat clubfoot.

However, 9.7% of the population still does not have access to insurance. The NGO program also supports treatment from casting to bracing, including tenotomy, for these individuals.   It is important to note that treatment covered by the national health insurance cannot be combined with NGO program support, as this would be considered a ""charity"" program, potentially leading to fraud (double financing).","- Due to the lack of human resources in the health sector, there is still no dedicated clubfoot clinic with specifically trained health workers. Clubfoot children attend the same clinic as other general patients with orthopedic problems, which may affect effective and efficient service delivery.
